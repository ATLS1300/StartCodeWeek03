# Starter Code - Week03
Welcome to Github! This platform will be used to share files with each other in the class. 

This week, we'll be drawing on images. When working with images, the file has to be in the same folder as your script (.py file).
**You must make sure all images you reference in the code is in the same folder as your script!**

In this repository there are 4 files:
    - "FullAda_Glam.gif" - A photo of Ada lovelace
    - "JustAda_Glam.gif" - Another photo of Ada lovelace
    - Turtle_Start.py - starter code for MP02 and general Turtle shenanigans. Always save as after opening!
    - Ada_Start.py - starter code for PC02
